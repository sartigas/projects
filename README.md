&emsp;Hi there, if you have landed on this Github repo then perhaps you found something useful. I have been in the IT industry since 1994 varying from role to role through my whole career. All started with programming languages like Basic, Turbo Pascal, C, C++, some COBOL a little bit of Assembler and a lot of Visual Basic, Oracle Forms and Oracle Reports then I jumped in to databases administration, Oracle databases mostly. I was OCA in 10g and I had baby steps in HP-UX and Solaris during my Oracle DBA stint and decided to focus on Linux where I read lots of manuals (tldp.org is a great site for newbies and seasoned users) and was fascinated on the idea of building relationships between hardware and software or middleware architecture. I like to make app servers work hand to hand with hardware having security in mind in both ends so I'm basically a mixture of a programmer, dba, middleware admin and Unix-like OS administrator. I understand each one of these layers and have seen many discussions about who has the top role, in the end, all, as a team, are in the same boat so this debate is as useful and meaningful as those discussions focusing on the best soccer team, just a waste of time.
<br /><br />
&emsp;My Unix-like OS journey started with Linux virtual machines on top of VMWare workstation on top of a laptop. I later found VirtualBox to be a much lighter option to run VMs and left VMWare workstation behind for good. Getting the grasp of how a Unix-like operating system works is a must and understand the majority of components that interact in between is fascinating and while many may find Linux GUI useful and comfortable, it's not the same when it comes to enterprise servers which are usually stored in data centers, stacked in racks, without a screen display and are accessed remotely through a command line tool. Enterprise servers are a challenging scenario because here is when you get to use all with what you have practiced in virtual machines, read in manuals, watched in tutorials or learned in trainings. There's little to no margin of errors and here is where proven experience is mandatory before putting a guy in front of production enterprise servers.
<br /><br />
&emsp;OS server health, monitor applications, handle backups, troubleshoot issues are challenging tasks if you don't have the right tools as well as working along with other IT teams or business teams. There are, of course, open source and paid solutions and while big companies can afford to buy paid subscriptions, it's always good to have knowledge of open source enterprise grade solutions too as every good server administrator should probably have. You might even have to "create" your own solutions using shell scripting or some other automation tool that simplifies the complexity of the problem you have in front. Every case may have a lot of solutions, it will all depend on your experience and tools at hand and allowed by software governance committee to figure it out and the solutions range is really wide and could go from a simple shell script to the adoption of an automation framework.
<br /><br />
&emsp;After many years of crafting solutions using shell scripts glued with isolated tools, I've decided to go one step higher and work with Python, Django and Ansible (both Python based frameworks). Combined, these 3 components are a powerhouse and a great improvement towards almost every task you could perform in one or many servers and it will be excellent of course to have this experience under your belt. You don't have to reinvent the wheel everytime you face a challenge but discover what's out there that can be useful for you and the organization you work for. Be organized, learn to program, choose a programming language, practice and above all, be careful when it comes to implement changes with destructive outcome, know all the risks and be prepared to undo the change when required. Make sure your backup files are not just stored somewhere but test they actually work and are useful in case of a disaster, it's the only way you will be 100% sure that you are prepared in such scenarios.
